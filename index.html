        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p> This workshop focuses on the development of software frameworks and workload management strategies that are crucial for hybrid Quantum-HPC ecosystems. As quantum computing progresses, integrating quantum processors with HPC systems presents significant opportunities to tackle complex, large-scale problems. Experts from academia, industry, and national labs will discuss the challenges of managing hybrid resources, along with cutting-edge research on middleware, scheduling algorithms, decomposition strategies, and benchmarking methodologies for Q-HPC systems. The workshop will include keynote talks, paper presentations, panel discussions, and interactive demos to foster collaboration and advance the state of hybrid computing. By the end of the workshop, attendees will gain valuable insights into best practices, emerging technologies, and future directions in Q-HPC integration, contributing to the broader goal of making quantum computing a practical extension of HPC environments.

        <h2>Workshop Scope</h2>
        <p> The integration of quantum computing (QC) with high-performance computing (HPC) is emerging as a critical paradigm for tackling complex scientific and engineering challenges. Current QC technology is constrained by the number of qubits, noise, and limited circuit depths, making hybrid Quantum-HPC (Q-HPC) ecosystems a practical approach to leveraging the strengths of both computing paradigms. However, realizing the full potential of Q-HPC systems requires advanced software frameworks that can efficiently manage heterogeneous resources, decompose large-scale problems, optimize execution workflows, and mitigate errors. </p>
        <p>
            This workshop will bring together experts from academia, industry, and national laboratories to discuss and advance the development of software frameworks and workload management strategies for Q-HPC ecosystems. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Resource Orchestration in Q-HPC Systems: Efficient scheduling, job allocation, and workload balancing across quantum and classical processors. </li>
        <li> Quantum-HPC Software Frameworks: Middleware and runtime systems that enable seamless execution of hybrid quantum-classical workloads. </li>
        <li> Scalability and Decomposition Strategies: Techniques for partitioning and distributing large-scale optimization and simulation problems. </li>
        <li> Error Mitigation and Noise Reduction Strategies: Software-based approaches for improving computational accuracy on NISQ devices. </li>
        <li> Programming Models and Abstractions: Development of high-level frameworks for interfacing quantum algorithms with HPC infrastructure. </li>
        <li> Benchmarking and Performance Metrics: Evaluation strategies for measuring the efficiency of Q-HPC workflows. </li>
        <li> Workflow Management and Automation: Tools for optimizing computational workflows across heterogeneous quantum and HPC platforms. </li>
    </li>
          <p>  By fostering discussions on these topics, the workshop aims to bridge the gap between quantum software development and classical HPC infrastructure, ultimately accelerating the practical deployment of Q-HPC applications.
